Block is a collection of required information (a block header) about the comprised transactions, and a set of other block headers known as ommers. Blocks are added to the Ethereum network by miners.

<CH.Code>

```js block.js
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

(async () => {
  const provider = new ethers.providers.AlchemyProvider();
  const block = await provider.getBlock(14292113);
  console.log(block);
})();
```

We use a default provider to query block information on the ethereum mainnet.

```js block.js focus=4

```

---

Get the block from the network at the latest height.

```js block.js focus=5
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

(async () => {
  const provider = new ethers.providers.AlchemyProvider();
  const block = await provider.getBlock();
  console.log(block);
})();
```

---

Or specify a block number.

```js block.js focus=5
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

(async () => {
  const provider = new ethers.providers.AlchemyProvider();
  const block = await provider.getBlock(14292113);
  console.log(block);
})();
```

Let's see what the block contains.

<CH.Code>

```sh block
* hash(mixHash) – a unique identifier for that block.
* parentHash – the unique identifier for the block that came before (this is how blocks are linked in a chain).
* number – the length of the blockchain in blocks.
* timestamp – the time when the block was mined.
* nonce – a hash that, when combined with the mixHash, proves that the block has gone through proof-of-work.
* difficulty – the effort required to mine the block.
* gasLimit - the maximum amount of gas that can be used in this block.
* gasUsed – the amount of gas used in this block.
* miner – the address of the miner who mined the block.
* extraData – the extra data that was included in the block.
* transactions – the transactions included in the block.
* baseFeePerGas - the minimum fee per gas required for a transaction to be included in the block.
```

```js block.js focus=6
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

(async () => {
  const provider = new ethers.providers.AlchemyProvider();
  const block = await provider.getBlock(14292113);
  console.log(block);
})();
```
