As <ins>[previous example](/deploying-a-smart-contract)</ins> shows, we have deployed a simple smart contract and got a contract address.
Now, we will connect to this contract.

<CH.Spotlight>

<CH.Code>

```js load-contract.js
const { ethers } = require("ethers");
const fs = require("fs");

(async () => {
  const abi = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("storage_sol_SimpleStorage.abi"));
  const address = "0x4deA5308A17Bc20589802f3E2C23e79Ba044d497";
  const provider = new ethers.providers.AlchemyProvider("goerli");

  const instance = new ethers.Contract(address, abi, provider);
  console.log("address", instance.address);

  const privateKey = fs.readFileSync("privatekey").toString();
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);
  const instance_rw = new ethers.Contract(address, abi, wallet);
  console.log("signer ", instance_rw.signer.address);
})();
```

```sh output
âžœ node load-contract.js
address 0x4deA5308A17Bc20589802f3E2C23e79Ba044d497
signer  0x67CF3bF40b2b3b3D68F6c361AEf81F8AEb2dB637
```

Creating a new instance of a Contract connects to an existing contract by specifying its **address** on the blockchain, its **abi** (used to populate the class' methods) and a **providerOrSigner**.

```js load-contract.js focus=5:7

```

---

If a Provider is given, the contract has only read-only access, allows:

\- Any constant function

\- Querying Filters

\- Populating Unsigned Transactions for non-constant methods

\- Estimating Gas for non-constant (as an anonymous sender)

\- Static Calling non-constant methods (as anonymous sender)

<CH.Code>

```js load-contract.js focus=9:10

```

---

```sh output focus=2

```

</CH.Code>

---

While a Signer(wallet) offers access to state manipulating methods.

\- Everything from Read-Only (except as Signer, not anonymous)

\- Sending transactions for non-constant functions

<CH.Code>

```js load-contract.js focus=12:15

```

---

```sh output focus=3

```

</CH.Code>
