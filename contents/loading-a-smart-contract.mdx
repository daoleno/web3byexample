As <ins>[previous example](/deploying-a-smart-contract)</ins> shows, we have deployed a simple smart contract and got a contract address.
Now, we will connect to this contract.

<CH.Spotlight>

<CH.Code>

```js load-contract.js
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

(async () => {
  const abi = [
    {
      inputs: [],
      name: "get",
      outputs: [{ internalType: "uint256", name: "", type: "uint256" }],
      stateMutability: "view",
      type: "function",
    },
    {
      inputs: [{ internalType: "uint256", name: "x", type: "uint256" }],
      name: "set",
      outputs: [],
      stateMutability: "nonpayable",
      type: "function",
    },
  ];

  const address = "0x4887B56a6ec7E25e0061d58194BB76e3078153f4";
  const provider = new ethers.providers.AlchemyProvider("goerli");
  const instance = new ethers.Contract(address, abi, provider);
  console.log("address", instance.address);

  const privateKey = "your-private-key";
  const signer = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);
  const instance_rw = new ethers.Contract(address, abi, signer);
  console.log("signer ", instance_rw.signer.address);
})();
```

```sh output
âžœ node load-contract.js
address 0x4887B56a6ec7E25e0061d58194BB76e3078153f4
signer  0x67CF3bF40b2b3b3D68F6c361AEf81F8AEb2dB637
```

Creating a new instance of a Contract connects to an existing contract by specifying its **address** on the blockchain, its **abi** (used to populate the class' methods) and a **providerOrSigner**.

```js load-contract.js focus=4:22,26:27

```

---

If a Provider is given, the contract has only read-only access, allows:

\- Any constant function

\- Querying Filters

\- Populating Unsigned Transactions for non-constant methods

\- Estimating Gas for non-constant (as an anonymous sender)

\- Static Calling non-constant methods (as anonymous sender)

<CH.Code>

```js load-contract.js focus=23:24

```

---

```sh output focus=2

```

</CH.Code>

---

While a Signer(wallet) offers access to state manipulating methods.

\- Everything from Read-Only (except as Signer, not anonymous)

\- Sending transactions for non-constant functions

<CH.Code>

```js load-contract.js focus=28:29

```

---

```sh output focus=3

```

</CH.Code>
