One of the most significant smart contract standards on Ethereum is known as ERC-20, which has emerged as the technical standard used for all smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for fungible token implementations.
We can call **transfer** function of ERC-20 token contract to transfer tokens from one address to another.

<CH.Code>

```js transfer-erc20.js
const ethers = require("ethers");

(async () => {
  const abi = [
    // Read-Only Functions
    "function balanceOf(address owner) view returns (uint256)",
    "function decimals() view returns (uint8)",
    "function symbol() view returns (string)",

    // Authenticated Functions
    "function transfer(address to, uint amount) returns (bool)",

    // Events
    "event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint amount)",
  ];

  const usdc = "0xD87Ba7A50B2E7E660f678A895E4B72E7CB4CCd9C";
  const usdcDecimals = 6;

  const provider = new ethers.providers.AlchemyProvider("goerli");
  const privateKey = "your-private-key";
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);
  const erc20_rw = new ethers.Contract(usdc, abi, wallet);

  const receipt = "0xddB51f100672Cb252C67D516eb79931bf27cE3E6";
  const amount = ethers.utils.parseUnits("0.1", usdcDecimals);
  const tx = await erc20_rw.transfer(receipt, amount);
  console.log("tx has been sent, waiting for confirmation. hash is ", tx.hash);

  await tx.wait();

  console.log(
    "balance",
    ethers.utils.formatUnits(await erc20_rw.balanceOf(receipt), usdcDecimals)
  );
})();
```

```sh output
âžœ node transfer-erc20.js
tx has been sent, waiting for confirmation. hash: 0xc851be4108a7d3eec6e1526e38fadf2cc7851db96a5d5b5987665b7b73836ad0
balance 0.1
```

Config a Human-Readable ABI for interacting with the contract, we
must include any fragment we wish to use.

```js transfer-erc20.js focus=4:15

```

---

And set a contract address, this also can be an ENS name.
We use **USDC** on Goerli as an example.

```js transfer-erc20.js focus=17:18

```

---

Create a contract instance. There are two types of contract instances,

```js transfer-erc20.js focus=20:23

```

---

Read-Only; By connecting to a Provider, allows:

\- Any constant function

\- Querying Filters

\- Populating Unsigned Transactions for non-constant methods

\- Estimating Gas for non-constant (as an anonymous sender)

\- Static Calling non-constant methods (as anonymous sender)

```js transfer-erc20.js focus=21
const ethers = require("ethers");

(async () => {
  const abi = [
    // Read-Only Functions
    "function balanceOf(address owner) view returns (uint256)",
    "function decimals() view returns (uint8)",
    "function symbol() view returns (string)",

    // Authenticated Functions
    "function transfer(address to, uint amount) returns (bool)",

    // Events
    "event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint amount)",
  ];

  const usdc = "0xD87Ba7A50B2E7E660f678A895E4B72E7CB4CCd9C";
  const usdcDecimals = 6;

  const provider = new ethers.providers.AlchemyProvider("goerli");
  const erc20 = new ethers.Contract(usdc, abi, provider);

  const privateKey = "your-private-key";
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);
  const erc20_rw = new ethers.Contract(usdc, abi, wallet);

  const receipt = "0xddB51f100672Cb252C67D516eb79931bf27cE3E6";
  const amount = ethers.utils.parseUnits("0.1", usdcDecimals);
  const tx = await erc20_rw.transfer(receipt, amount);
  console.log("tx has been sent, waiting for confirmation. hash is ", tx.hash);

  await tx.wait();

  console.log(
    "balance",
    ethers.utils.formatUnits(await erc20_rw.balanceOf(receipt), usdcDecimals)
  );
})();
```

---

Read-Write; By connecting to a Signer, allows:

\- Everything from Read-Only (except as Signer, not anonymous)

\- Sending transactions for non-constant functions

```js transfer-erc20.js focus=23

```

---

Transfer 0.1 UDSC to receipt. As the code shows, we can directly call function **transfer** of the contract(abi).

<CH.Code>

```js transfer-erc20.js focus=11,25:28

```

---

```sh output focus=2

```

</CH.Code>

---

Wait for the transaction to be mined.

```js transfer-erc20.js focus=30

```

---

Checkout the receipt balance. You will see the balance has increased.

<CH.Code>

```js transfer-erc20.js focus=32:35

```

---

```sh output focus=3

```

</CH.Code>
