We can check if the address is a valid account or if it is a contract address.

<CH.Spotlight>

<CH.Code>

```js address.js
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

(async () => {
  const address = "0x67CF3bF40b2b3b3D68F6c361AEf81F8AEb2dB637";
  const isValid = ethers.utils.isAddress(address);
  console.log("isValid", isValid);

  const provider = new ethers.providers.AlchemyProvider();
  const weth = "0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2";
  const code = await provider.getCode(weth);
  const isContract = code !== "0x";
  console.log("isContract", isContract);
})();
```

```sh output
âžœ node address.js
isValid true
isContract true
```

</CH.Code>

**isAddress** returns true if address is valid (in any supported format).

<CH.Code>

```js address.js focus=5

```

---

```sh output focus=2

```

</CH.Code>

---

**getCode** returns the contract code of address. If there is no contract currently deployed, the result is 0x.

<CH.Code>

```js address.js focus=10:11

```

---

```sh output focus=3

```
