In this example we’ll see how to call a smart contract function from JavaScript.

<CH.Spotlight>

<CH.Code>

```js query-contract.js
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

(async () => {
  const abi = [
    {
      inputs: [],
      name: "get",
      outputs: [{ internalType: "uint256", name: "", type: "uint256" }],
      stateMutability: "view",
      type: "function",
    },
    {
      inputs: [{ internalType: "uint256", name: "x", type: "uint256" }],
      name: "set",
      outputs: [],
      stateMutability: "nonpayable",
      type: "function",
    },
  ];

  const address = "0x4887B56a6ec7E25e0061d58194BB76e3078153f4";
  const provider = new ethers.providers.AlchemyProvider("goerli");
  const instance = new ethers.Contract(address, abi, provider);

  const result = await instance.get();
  console.log(result.toString());
})();
```

```sh output
➜ node query-contract.js
0
```

</CH.Code>

After loading the smart contract, we can call a function using **instance**.

```js query-contract.js focus=4:23

```

---

In the <ins>[SimpleStore](/smart-contract-compilation-abi)</ins> contract, we have a function called `get()` that returns the current value.
Let's call it.

```js query-contract.js focus=25

```

---

You will see the result is 0 because we haven't set a value yet. But it's a successful call!

<CH.Code>

```js query-contract.js focus=26

```

---

```sh output

```

</CH.Code>
