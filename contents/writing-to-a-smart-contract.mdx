In this example we’ll see how to write a smart contract function from JavaScript.

<CH.Code>

```js write-contract.js
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

(async () => {
  const abi = [
    {
      inputs: [],
      name: "get",
      outputs: [{ internalType: "uint256", name: "", type: "uint256" }],
      stateMutability: "view",
      type: "function",
    },
    {
      inputs: [{ internalType: "uint256", name: "x", type: "uint256" }],
      name: "set",
      outputs: [],
      stateMutability: "nonpayable",
      type: "function",
    },
  ];

  const address = "0x4887B56a6ec7E25e0061d58194BB76e3078153f4";
  const provider = new ethers.providers.AlchemyProvider("goerli");
  const privateKey =
    "c1edce0700e9d002c30f15f6de60eb5ffffdeb79629f663d8862aba7af3f689d";
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);
  const instance_rw = new ethers.Contract(address, abi, wallet);

  const tx = await instance_rw.set(42);
  console.log("hash", tx.hash);

  const receipt = await tx.wait();
  console.log("status", receipt.status);

  const value = await instance_rw.get();
  console.log("value", value.toString());
})();
```

```sh output
➜ node write-contract.js
hash 0x460a3645a3adcfbc3842920cfe6fbcd7bd048d006d45489b777caf7d520be792
status 1
value 42
```

</CH.Code>

---

We will load a read-write contract that has a signer can send transactions.

```js write-contract.js focus=4:26

```

---

In the <ins>[SimpleStore](/smart-contract-compilation-abi)</ins> contract,
we have a function called `set()` that takes a single parameter _x_.
We will set the x value to 42.
This action sends a transaction to the network.

<CH.Code>

```js write-contract.js focus=28:29

```

---

```sh output focus=2

```

</CH.Code>

---

Wait for the transaction to be mined. If the status of receipt is 1, that means the transaction was mined successfully.

<CH.Code>

```js write-contract.js focus=31:32

```

---

```sh output focus=3

```

</CH.Code>

---

After the transaction is mined, we can read the value. See, the value is now 42.
That means that the contract has been updated.

<CH.Code>

```js write-contract.js focus=34:35

```

---

```sh output focus=4

```

</CH.Code>
