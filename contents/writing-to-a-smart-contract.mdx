In this example we’ll see how to write a smart contract function from JavaScript.

<CH.Spotlight>

<CH.Code>

```js write-contract.js
const { ethers } = require("ethers");
const fs = require("fs");

(async () => {
  const abi = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("storage_sol_SimpleStorage.abi"));
  const address = "0x4deA5308A17Bc20589802f3E2C23e79Ba044d497";
  const provider = new ethers.providers.AlchemyProvider("goerli");
  const privateKey = fs.readFileSync("privatekey").toString();
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);
  const instance_rw = new ethers.Contract(address, abi, wallet);

  const tx = await instance_rw.setValue("web3byexample");
  console.log("hash", tx.hash);

  const receipt = await tx.wait();
  console.log("status", receipt.status);

  const value = await instance_rw.getValue();
  console.log("value", value.toString());
})();
```

```sh output
➜ node write-contract.js
hash 0x9c6810cf3f53f033ae5c242fac2bd4d8973816156c68c587734c365061301157
status 1
value web3byexample
```

</CH.Code>

We will load a read-write contract that has a signer can send transactions.

```js write-contract.js focus=5:10

```

---

In the <ins>[SimpleStore](/smart-contract-compilation-abi)</ins> contract,
we have a function called **setValue()** that takes a single parameter value.
We will set the value to **web3byexample**.
This action sends a transaction to the network.

<CH.Code>

```js write-contract.js focus=12:13

```

---

```sh output focus=2

```

</CH.Code>

---

Wait for the transaction to be mined. If the status of receipt is 1, that means the transaction was mined successfully.

<CH.Code>

```js write-contract.js focus=15:16

```

---

```sh output focus=3

```

</CH.Code>

---

After the transaction is mined, we can read the value. See, the value is now **web3byexample**.
That means that the contract has been updated.

<CH.Code>

```js write-contract.js focus=18:19

```

---

```sh output focus=4

```

</CH.Code>
